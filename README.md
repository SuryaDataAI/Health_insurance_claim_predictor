# Health_insurance_claim_predictor
Machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a health insurance claim based on customer demographics, medical history, and lifestyle data. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation for accurate risk assessment.


# 🏥 Health Insurance Claim Predictor – ML-Powered Risk Assessment

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a health insurance claim based on customer demographics, medical history, and lifestyle data.  
It combines **data preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, and **predictive modeling** to support smarter, data-driven decision-making for insurers.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Data Processing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies trends in customer demographics, claim frequency, and health indicators.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generates new predictive features for improved model accuracy.
- **Model Training:** Compares multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure performance.
- **Business Applications:** Supports premium optimization, fraud detection, and claim risk assessment.
